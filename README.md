### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name's Dominick! I am beyond passionate about all forms of technology across all fronts. I mainly work with Javascript in the flavors of Node and React to bring my ideas to life on the magical place that is the internet. I love creating tools, projects, and applications for people to use that make the small parts of their days better. My favorite projects have been my [Discord Bot](https://github.com/Blugil/jobiebot) and my [Twitch Bot](https://github.com/Blugil/blubot) both of which I use almost daily and am constantly working to improve on.
